# foobar-challenge
Suddenly, the Google search bar changed and asked if I wanted to join foobar. At first I thought I was hacked. Still, I pressed the participate button out of curiosity. After accepting the invitation, I was able to reach the following screen.

In a panic, I typed foobar challenge into the Google search bar. Surprisingly, this challenge was actually a challenge conducted by Google, and the purpose of the Poobah Challenge was for Google recruitment. And there was also a story about someone who actually got an interview at Google through the following route. Of course, it may or may not be real, but the process is written in great detail, so it doesn't seem to be a lie. I suddenly became interested and looked for more information. However, recently, the prevailing view is that the Poobah Challenge is viewed as an event or egg-eating rather than a recruitment process.

Still, wouldnâ€™t Google be able to hire me?? I thought about it. So I thought about it. Am I really talented enough to go to Google?

Google's hiring philosophy is 'Don't hire people without talent, even if you lose talent.' I don't know if I'm a talented person or not. But what is certain is that Google is now looking for LLM experts. I can't remember the exact keyword that got me an invitation, but it was about mamba. However, I am someone who has never dealt with the LLM model before. While researching about the mamba that fights against transformers, I was lucky enough to be invited.

I plan to send my resume for fun in the distant future when I feel more prepared.

So, I decided to solve the problems step by step, with the goal of just preparing for the coding test.

This repository is merely a record of challenges.

# foobar-challenge
Suddenly, Google's search bar changed and asked me if I wanted to join foobar. At first I thought I had been hacked. Still, out of curiosity, I pressed the button to participate. After accepting the invitation, I was able to reach the following screen.

  Out of embarrassment, I typed foobar challenge into the Google search box. Surprisingly, this challenge was actually a challenge run by Google, and the purpose of the foobar challenge was for Google recruitment. And there was also a story about someone who actually got an interview at Google through the following route. Of course, it may or may not be real, but it doesn't seem like it was a lie, as the process was written down in great detail. Suddenly interested, I searched for more information. However, the recent view of the foobar challenge as an event or eater egg rather than a recruitment process has prevailed.

Still, maybe Google could hire me?? I had a thought. So I thought about it. Am I truly talented enough to go to Google?

  Google's hiring philosophy is, “Let's not hire people who are not talented, even if it means losing talented people.” When I first looked at myself, I realized that I was definitely not the right talent for Google.

  And the basis for being sure of this is as follows. What I kept searching for at that time was about mamba. In my opinion, the talent Google wants right now is an LLM deep learning expert. So, I expect that I received an invitation like this. However, I am someone who has never dealt with the LLM model. I was just lucky enough to receive an invitation while working as an ECo Lab intern, and it became even more certain.

  So, I decided to just prepare for coding test and solve the problems step by step.

  This repository is just a record book of challenge.
